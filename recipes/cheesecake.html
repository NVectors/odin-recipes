        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <h4> FOR THE CRUST</h4>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F and set an oven rack in the lower middle position.
                Wrap a 9- or 10-inch springform pan with one large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
                covering the underside and extending all the way to the top so there are no seams
                on the bottom or sides of the pan. Repeat with another sheet of foil for insurance.
                Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt.
                Stir until well combined. Press the crumbs into an even layer on the the bottom of
                the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove the pan from the oven
                and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Set a kettle of water to boil.</li>

            <li>Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment
                or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour together on medium speed until
                just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure
                the mixture is evenly combined. Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt;
                beat on low speed until just combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on
                low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Mix in the sour cream.
                Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix.
            </li>

            <li>
                Check to make sure your oven has cooled to 325°F, then set the cheesecake pan in a
                large roasting pan. Pour the batter on top of the crust. Pour the boiling water
                into the large roasting pan to come about 1 inch up the side of the cake pan.
                Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes
                (the cake should not look liquidy at all but will wobble just a bit when the pan
                is nudged; it will continue to cook as it cools). Carefully remove the roasting pan
                from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until
                the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water
                bath and discard the foil. If necessary, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge
                of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as
                it cools), then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to cool
                for at least 8 hours or overnight.
            </li>


            <h4>FOR SERVING</h4>
            <li>Remove the sides of the springform pan. Serve the cheesecake right from the base of the pan;
                or, to transfer it to a serving platter, run a long, thin spatula between the crust and
                the pan bottom, and then use two large spatulas to carefully transfer the cheesecake to
                a serving dish. Slice with a sharp knife, wiping the knife clean between slices.
                Serve with berry sauce, if you like.
            </li>

            <h4>MAKE AHEAD</h4>
            <li>The cheesecake can be made and stored in the springform pan in the fridge,
                tightly covered with plastic wrap, up to two days ahead of time.
            </li>

            <h4>FREEZER-FRIENDLY INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
            <li>
                The cheesecake can be frozen for up to 3 months. To freeze, place the cake in the freezer
                briefly, unwrapped, to firm it up. Then double-wrap it tightly with aluminum foil or
                plastic freezer wrap, or place it in heavy-duty freezer bag.
                Thaw in the refrigerator the night before you plan to eat it.
