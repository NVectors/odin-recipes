<h2> HTML Recipe Website </h2>
<p>The website has a very basic design. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.</p> 
<p>The purpose of this recipe website is to demonstrate my understanding of the HTML Foundation course at the https://www.theodinproject.com/</p>
<p>I learned the basic structure of a HTML, what elements and tag are, how to link and how to add text/images to a website.</p>
